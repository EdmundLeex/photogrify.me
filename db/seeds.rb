SF_DESCRIPTION = <<-SF
	September and October are ideal months for visiting San Francisco if you desire good weather during your stay. October tends to be just a slight bit chillier than September with a tiny chance of rain compared (compared to dry September) but the two months are very similar. There are great events to enjoy in the Bay Area in October including a few of the biggest outdoor festivals of the year. The windiness of the summer months has calmed down and the accompanying biting chill has dissipated. Often there is also a drop in hotel prices in San Francisco during the fall months so you can enjoy the beautiful weather and big events at an affordable price. - See more at: http://sftodo.com/blog/#sthash.az5zloY4.dpuf

YOSEMITE_DESCRIPTION = <<YO
	I've visited Yosemite National Park more times than I can count, always trying to avoid the biggest crowds. It's a cinch to find solitude in a giant sequoia grove blanketed by snow in winter. But what about exploring the park during peak travel times, when waterfalls peak in late spring and during the busy summer season from Memorial Day to Labor Day?

Here's what I've learned after years of getting stuck in Yosemite Valley traffic jams, being turned away from full campgrounds and jostling with marching armies of vacationing families on the park's most popular trails. (It also helps to have worked for two seasons as a national park ranger in the Sierra Nevada, I admit, so get ready for some insider tips.)

LA_DESCRIPTION = <<-LA
	Drop your preconceptions about Los Angeles and explore a sprawling heap of dozens of mini cities coexisting (or struggling to coexist) in a oddly charming bazaar of cultural and physical diversity. It’s a city with an eclectic history, bearing the relics and scars to prove it, that has amounted to something of a dysfunctional United Nations after party. Beautiful beaches, great weather, lots going on, and a place for every kind of person to enjoy it all. Sunset Boulevard alone sets corporate skyscrapers next to artsy villages, with cultural marketplaces just a few miles from upscale shopping. An unlikely collection of people lay claim to Los Angeles, and she tries to find a place for them all. Maybe Los Angeles herself is quite the opposite of superficial.

Okay, fine – there is too much traffic.
LA

VEGAS_DESCRIPTION = <<-VEGAS
	I can’t believe I’m typing up a blog post at 6:30 am without coffee. Remember when I posted my other Vegas trip recaps? Well, those got a little out of hand and sloppy, so I wanted to keep up with these as soon as I could, rather than posting pictures and trying to remember the sequence.

I finally got into Vegas around 1:30 in the afternoon. Jeremy’s flight was delayed because of the snow in Chicago, so I had to wait a little longer for him. I would have gone to the hotel, but our hotel reservation was under his name. I didn’t mind hanging around the airport and working on the computer.

5pm rolled around and I was so hungry! I stopped at a little cafe and picked up a Caesar salad and a bag of almonds. This held me over for a while.
VEGAS

GRAND_CANYON_DESCRIPTION = <<-GRAND_CANYON
	The Grand Canyon is a steep-sided canyon carved by the Colorado River and its tributaries which cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted.

Recent evidence suggests the Colorado River established its course through the canyon at least 17 million years ago.

Our road trip had followed the Colorado River down from her beginnings in the Rocky Mountains and we saw how she grew and widened, her twists and turns carving her magic and forming her overwhelming size.
